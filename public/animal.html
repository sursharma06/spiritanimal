    <h1>My Worth</h1>
    <p>Grumpy Cat is a fur bundle with a lovably cantankerous punim and a mouth like an isosceles triangle where the bottom has come detached. Since appearing on Reddit in 2012, it (n√©e "Tardar Sauce") has become "Internet famous," which is becoming a less useful term now that billions of people around the world are practically breathing the Internet all day long. (Does anybody say, "she's just primetime cable-TV famous"?) Indeed, Grumpy Cat is famous, period, and its owner has licensed her pet's very real and enormous fame to make a great sum of money, as she should.

The Daily Express reports that Grumpy Cat has made $100 million in the last two years. That means its owner, the former waitress Tabatha Bundesen, is making more money than all but a handful of actors and athletes in the world, even when you include their endorsements, licenses, and filmed appearances. (Indeed, endorsements, licenses, and filmed appearances is exactly how Grumpy Cat makes its money, too.)</p>
